Toons are not only the characters you play as in Dandy's World, they can also be the twisteds you go up against! Yes, some are better then others! Below is a table of all the toons, but please have this simple reminder: Yes, Dandy is a toon, and you can play as him in the roleplay section, but as he isn't playable in-game (apart from devs), I have not included him.
