Toons are not only the characters you play as in Dandy's World, they can also be the twisteds you go up against! Yes, some are better then others! Below is a table of all the toons, but please have this simple reminder: Yes, Dandy is a toon, and you can play as him in the roleplay section, but as he isn't playable in-game (apart from devs), I have not included him.

Also, sorry for the stats section looking a little strange... it refused to let me adjust the size and as this website is run by one developer I have no one to help me so I just kinda... left it...
